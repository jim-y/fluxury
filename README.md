fluxury - latest
================

[Project Home Page](http://jim-y.me/fluxury/)

Version 2.0.0 no longer use Grunt for the build process, nor Backbone, for data
modelling. Instead, it uses npm as a build tool, and ImmutableJS for state
management.

If someone is interested on the initial application with `Grunt` and `Backbone` one should check out the tag **v0.2**.

The template contains an implementation of Dartlang's [Avast, Ye Pirates](https://www.dartlang.org/codelabs/darrrt/) written in flux.
